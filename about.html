    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>I am a recent graduate of UCLA, where I studied Mathematics/Economics.
    I graduated <em>summa cum laude</em> with a Specialization in Computing,
    and was given the Outstanding Student in Mathematics/Economics award.</p>
    <p>Soon, I will start at the Federal Reserve as an RA, in the Division of 
    International Finance. Eventually, I intend to pursue a PhD in economics.
    </p>
    <p>I have extensive research experience, beginning from my first year of
    college. At UCLA, I have worked as a research assistant for PhD student
    Zhihao Xu, as well as for faculty members Melanie Wasserman (UCLA Anderson)
    , Michela Giorcelli (UCLA), Rosa Matzkin (UCLA), and Martha Bailey (UCLA). 
    In the summer of 2021, I interned at the Federal Reserve Board, where I 
    worked in the Division of International Finance, under the supervision of 
    Dario Caldara and Anna Lipinska.</p>
    <p>I have conducted research in applied microeconomics, economic history,
    and international economics. My projects have studied Head Start, an early
    education program for disadvantaged youth in the U.S., and currency crises
    in developing countries.</p>
    <p>In my free time, I love to cook and play board games.</p>
